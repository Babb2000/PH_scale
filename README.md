Creating a Website displaying pH Scale/Walkthrough from Jon Ducketts Book Chapter 11


Objective: 
  Practice using different color code values, mainly focused on RGB Values. As well as understanding the 
hierarchy of CSS. 

Summary:
  Seen how styles declared within the body element in CSS are automatically inherited by child elements, as this was the case with the font-family style. However child elements are allowed to inherit any style from their parent element just by using the inherit keyword next to the declaration. When creating websites I need to keep in mind that some older browsers don't recognzie hsl or hsla values. So I should keep it a habit to add the default hex color or rgb values after the hsl/hsla declaration to give browsers something to fall back on(same thing goes for rgba/etc..). Have a pretty good understanding on how to layout foreground colors over background-colors so that text is readable and visually appealing.
